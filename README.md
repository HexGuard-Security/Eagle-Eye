## üîß Technical Requirements

- **Rust** 1.75 or higher
- **Modern Web Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Internet Connection** (required for satellite imagery retrieval)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hexguard/eagle-eye.git
cd eagle-eye

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the application
cargo run --release
```

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Starting the Application

After running the application, open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Using the Interface

1. **Splash Screen**: Click the "LAUNCH APPLICATION" button to access the main interface
2. **Navigation**: Use the map controls to zoom in/out and navigate to areas of interest
3. **Imagery Retrieval**:
   - Navigate to your area of interest
   - (Optional) Select a date for historical imagery
   - Click "Get EOS Imagery" to retrieve satellite data
4. **Measurement & Analysis**:
   - Use the measurement tool to calculate distances and areas
   - Add markers to identify points of interest
   - Draw polygons to highlight regions for analysis
5. **Capturing Intelligence**:
   - Use the screenshot function to capture the current view
   - Images are saved locally in PNG format

### URL Parameters

Eagle-Eye supports direct access to locations via URL parameters:

```
http://localhost:8080/?lat=12.99979&lng=77.66641&z=14
```

Parameters:
- `lat`: Latitude (decimal degrees)
- `lng`: Longitude (decimal degrees)
- `z`: Zoom level (optional, default: 12)
- `date`: Date for historical imagery in YYYY-MM-DD format (optional)

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Eagle-Eye does not currently require API keys, but some satellite providers may in future versions
- **Data Storage**: All data is processed locally; no server-side storage of coordinates or imagery occurs
- **Network Security**: Ensure your network connection is secure when retrieving sensitive imagery
- **Operational Security**: Be aware that some satellite providers may log access patterns and requests

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

Eagle-Eye is built using a hybrid architecture:

- **Backend**: Rust with Actix Web framework for high-performance, secure operations
- **Frontend**: Modern JavaScript with Leaflet.js for interactive mapping capabilities
- **Data Processing**: Client-side processing for imagery analysis and measurement calculations
